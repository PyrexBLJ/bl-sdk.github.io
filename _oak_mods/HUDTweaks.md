SDK mod that lets you scale your HUD (again). This used to be a vanilla option but gearbox removed it for some reason.


Also includes options for hiding guardian rank/vault card bars and skill point notifications. These may take a save quit to take effect.


Last option is what shows next to your health bar. Usually its your class name, but now you can choose your class mod or nothing as well.


Known Issues:

The HUD doesn't scale instantly or doesn't scale. This is because there's no clear time when the HUD gets set. Opening and closing your Echo will fix this.
