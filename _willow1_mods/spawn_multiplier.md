Adds an option to let you easily multiply the amount of spawns you're getting, updating live.

## Softlocks
This mod is known to cause softlocks. The game handles "kill all enemies" objectives in half a dozen
different ways for example, and not all of them interact with this properly. When something
softlocks, SQing and disabling the mod, completing the objective without it, and then re-enabling
it, should let you progress further.

These softlocks are not considered bugs, they're just the cost of doing business. The only bugs are
ones that break your save, and prevent progressing even after disabling the mod. This is not to say
that spawns which softlock won't be blacklisted at some point, just that I won't spend time actively
hunting them all down.
