Adds alt use binds to vendors to let you quickly refill health and ammo and sell trash, like in
BL3/Wonderlands.

### Coop
In coop there are a few visual oddities, however it functions perfectly fine.

- Off host players can't see the alt use icons on vendors, however they can still press alt use to
  trigger them, they're just not displayed.

- The prices the host sees on the icon may actually belong to another player - it's possible to
  still see a buy ammo prompt while being full. On pressing alt use each player is correctly charged
  according to their resources.
