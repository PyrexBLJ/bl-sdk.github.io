This mod will let you use your movement keys (in my case WASD) to control a bunch of menus. It also enables your Use key (in my case E) to select items in menus. The mod will automatically adjust to your keys.


Current Working Menus:

Status Menus (Backpack, Missions, etc)

Fast Travel

Vending Machines

Quest/Rewards

Dialog Boxes, like the quit out screen

Vehicle station, but only left and right on the first screen

Stash Menus




Secondary Features:

You can hit your reload key on your weapons and gear to cycle if an item is favorited or trash

The main menu and pause menu now wrap, allowing you to quickly go to the top or bottom of the list

Alt Use to quick buy in vendors (including vendors like Earl)

Equipping gear from your backpack will no longer ask where you want to equip it

Quick Respec by hitting you reload key in the New U Menu

Pressing your Status Menu (in my case Tab) to close the fast travel, vending machines, stash, and mission accept menus

Home/End to quickly go to the top or bottom of your backpack or bank

Secondary Use to quickly unequip equipped items without having to drag them
